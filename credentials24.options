# image.options.template
# Copy this file to 'my.options' and edit it to customize your build.
# Then, run the build with the -o flag: ./build.sh -c <config_file> -o my.options

# Set a custom name for the final image file and the internal id.
# This is very recommended for tracking builds in a lab environment.
