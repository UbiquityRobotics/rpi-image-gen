**Ubiquity Robotics Custom Image with ROS 2**

**Overview**

This is a **custom Ubiquity Robotics image** built on **Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble)** with **ROS 2 Jazzy** plus our in-house software for camera-based robotics applications.

The image includes:

* **ROS 2 Jazzy** - Latest ROS 2 distribution with development tools
* **WiFi Access Point** - Automatic hotspot creation for easy connection
* **Ubiquity custom software** 

**Getting Started**

**First Boot**

When the device boots for the first time:

1. The system automatically configures a **WiFi Access Point**
2. The hostname is set to `ubiquityrobotXXXX` where `XXXX` are the last 4 digits of the MAC address
3. The Access Point uses the same name as the hostname
4. Default credentials: **username:** `ubuntu` **password:** `robotseverywhere`

**Connecting to the Access Point**

**Step 1: Find and Connect to the WiFi Network**

1. **Scan for available networks:**
   Look for a network named `ubiquityrobotXXXX` (where XXXX matches your device)

2. **Connect using the password:** `robotseverywhere`


3. **Your device should receive an IP address** in the range `192.168.4.2` - `192.168.4.20`

**Step 2: SSH into the Device**

    ssh ubuntu@IPadresss

Once connected to the Access Point:

**Configuring WiFi Connection**

Once you're connected via SSH, you can configure the device to connect to your home WiFi network.

**Using NetworkManager CLI (nmcli)**

**List Available Networks**

     sudo nmcli dev wifi


**Connect to Your WiFi Network**

    sudo nmcli dev wifi connect “YourWiFiNetworkName” password “YourWiFiPassword”

Once you connected to the wifi you will probably lose your connection to the Raspberry Pi. Now find the IP that your router assigned to the Pi and again ssh into it.
